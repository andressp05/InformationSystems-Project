    <h3> Game Rules </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It is a two players online game. </li>
        <li>The playerâ€™s moves alternate with the cat moving first. </li>
        <li>The player may move only one piece each turn. </li>
        <li>The mouse is trapped when it can no longer move to a vacant square. It is
          possible for two cats to trap the mouse against an edge of the board (other
          than their original home-row) or even one corner where a single cat may do the
          trapping. Should a cat reach the mouse original home row it will be unable to move further. </li>
        <li><b>4-Cats Player:</b>
          <ul>
            <li><u>Initial Position:</u> The four cats are initially placed on the white squares at one edge of the board.</li>
            <li><u>Objective:</u> To prevent the mouse from arriving to any of the inital cats positions.</li>
            <li><u>Allowed Movements:</u> The cat move diagonally forward one square.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Mouse Player:</b>
          <ul>
            <li><u>Initial Position:</u> The mouse is initially placed on the second white square at the opposite edge of the board.</li>
            <li><u>Objective:</u> To cross from one side of the board to the other, arriving at any one of the cat original squares.</li>
            <li><u>Allowed Movements:</u> The mouse moves diagonally forward or backward one square.</li>
          </ul>
